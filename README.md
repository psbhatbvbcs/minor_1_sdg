This app is mainly categorised into three major sections:
* ### Admin Section: [Role: ADMIN]
  - **Contact Messages:** Admin can see all the open contact messages submitted by contact page form. Once he contacts the user he can close that particular ticket.

Based on the profile he can either hire that candidate (Sending interview mail invitation) or reject that candidate (Sending rejection mail).
